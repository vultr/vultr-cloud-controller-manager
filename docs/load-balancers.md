# Load Balancers

## Overview

Kubernetes Services type `LoadBalancer` will be deployed through [Vultr Load Balancers](https://www.vultr.com/products/load-balancers/). This is provisioned by the Cloud Controller Manager. For generic info and faq please visit the [Vultr LoadBalancer Doc](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-load-balancers).

Examples of `LoadBalancer` resources can be found [here](examples)

## Annotations

The Vultr CCM allows you to configure your `LoadBalancer` resource to be deployed in a specific way through annotations.

The annotations are listed below. Please note that all annotations listed below **must** be prepended with `service.beta.kubernetes.io/vultr-loadbalancer-` and are case sensitive.

| Annotation (Suffix)                | Values                            | Default                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
